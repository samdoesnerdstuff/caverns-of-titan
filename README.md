**Caverns of Titan** is an explorative roguelite game developed in Lua for the **Game Off 2025 Game Jam**!  
As per the rules of the jam, the source code and assets are open source.  
All code and materials in this project are licensed under the **[Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE)**.

### What Is This Game?

At its core, *Caverns of Titan* is about exploration and survival in the icy depths of Titan, the largest moon of Saturn.  
Beneath its dense atmosphere and frozen surface lies a sprawling cave network teeming with alien life and ancient secrets.  
You are an explorer — lost, alone, and determined to see how deep you can go before the cold claims you.

## The Tech

I prefer **FOSS / free tools** whenever possible, so here’s the stack:
- **[Löve2D](https://love2d.org)** — the main framework (Lua-based, open-source, zlib license).
- **[Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite)** — for pixel art (self-built, free, rock solid).
- **FL Studio** — for music. Yeah, not open-source, but it’s what I know best, and I already own it.

## The Goal

The objective is simple:  
By the end of the 30-day jam, the game should be playable, stable, and have a clear, documented codebase suitable for future expansion into a **commercial release**.

> [!NOTE]
> Future commercial versions of *Caverns of Titan* may include proprietary assets, integrations, or content not covered under the Apache 2.0 license.

<!-- Hidden comment: Regardless of jam results, this project will continue if there’s player interest. -->
