# Caverns of Titan

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made_with-Lua-blue?logo=lua&logoColor=%23FFFFFF)

Caverns of Titan is an explorative roguelite game developed in Lua for the Game Off 2025 Game Jam! As per the rules of the jam, the source code and assets are open source. The code and materials in this project are licensed under *[Apache-2.0](./LICENSE)*.

So: what *is* this game, outside of its genre? This is a game about exploration and survival in the icy depths of Titan, the largest moon of the planet Saturn. Underneath the thick atmosphere and extremely cold surface, these frozen depths are a sprawling cave system filled with impossible lifeforms and otherworldly treasure and goods. As an explorer, lost in this endless expansive maze of caves; your only goal is to explore as deep as you can and survive as long as you can.

## The Tech

I'm all about not paying comedic amounts of money for tools, so I like FOSS/free soutions. As the primary framework behind this game, I chose **[LÃ¶ve2D](https://love2d.org)**. Love is an amazing framework for Lua-based game development. It lets me work in an awesome language, and Love is open-source and very liberally licensed (zlib) which allows for commercial and non-commercial free usage.

For art, I use **[Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite)** since it's an art program that's free (when you build yourself of course) and **it just works!**

Finally, for music, I use... FL Studio. I know, it kind of goes against my FOSS ethos, but I already own FL and am actively learning it.

## The Goal

The goal is simple. By the end of the 30 days for the allotted time, the game should be in a stable state and have a well documented codebase for future expansion into a commercial project.
<!-- Hidden comment: Regardless of placement in the jam, this'll be expanded on as long as there's some interest in my work -->
